## My process

The process of building this landing page started with sketching the design and then building it with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Bootsrtap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

During my process of building this website I've learned a lot about Bootstrap and positioning elements with Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

## Acknowledgments

At the time I've completed this project I was enrolled in the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele which is a great teacher who inspired me to learn more about both Flexbox and Bootstrap.
